# ARDUINO_WITH_BUNK_LED
The ARDUINO_WITH_BUNK_LED project is a simple microcontroller-based application designed using an Arduino board to simulate and indicate a "bunk" status using an LED indicator. This project can be extended or used in educational environments to visualize concepts like attendance tracking, warning systems, or basic digital logic simulation.
